CSS and JS

CSS is written using SASS, JS is in coffeescript, and both are managed with
gulp. The coffee is compiled with webpack. Assuming you already have node and
npm installed, to install all of the packages required to compile these files,
run:

	npm install

Then to start gulp watching and compiling the files, run:

	gulp
